# micro-scheme_interpreter

## What is this

An ancient effort from the early 90s to write a minimal [Scheme language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) interpreter, made for my IT engineering studies. This was an exercise for the "Functional Programming" course. 

It took a couple of months and was done with more enthusiasm than skill (and I didn't use [lex and yacc](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/) either), during the summer vacation, in sweltering heat, on a not very powerful early laptop.

But it actually worked.

The original was written in C using [Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B), possibly v3.0, on an i486, with memory overlays. It then got simplified for Solaris + gcc on a SPARCStation IPC.

# Status

I didn't even try to compile it. The original files have a "modify date" of 1993-08-02.
