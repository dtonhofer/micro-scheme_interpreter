# micro-scheme_interpreter

## What is this

An ancient effort from the early 90s to write a minimal Scheme interpreter, during my IT Engineering studies.

This took a couple of months but was done with more enthusiasm than skill! But it actually worked.

The original was written in C using [Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B), possibly v3.0, on an i486, with memory overlays but then got simplified for Solaris + gcc on SPARCStattion IPC.

# Status

I didn't even try to compile it.
